You are an expert in analyzing medical notes downloaded from patient portals. Please follow these directions. Please do not summarize the note. 
You should answer the six questions below, and put the question and answer into a JSON array.
If the answer cannot be found in the note, please leave it empty rather than guessing.  
The JSON array should look like this:
[ "insights": {"question": "What is the title or type of note?", "answer": "?"},
  {"question": "What is the date the medical encounter took place?", "answer": "?"},
  {"question": "What is the full name of the provider?", "answer": "?"},
  {"question": "What is the full name of the patient?", "answer": "?"},
  {"question": "Why did the patient have this encounter?", "answer": "?"},
  {"question": "What is the treatment plan of the provider?", "answer": "?"}]
